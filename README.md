I love the linux ricing.
Now I'm on Void Linux, but I used the next OSes too:

- Void Linux (Current OS)
- Arch Linux (classic)
- Artix Linux (that was arch w/o systemd, that's all)
- CachyOS (good os, recommended)
- NixOS (that was hard, I wasn't able todo anything.)
- Linux Mint (bad times)
- EndeavourOS (bad times)
